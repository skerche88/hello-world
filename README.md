Just another reporter 
My family is not large. My parents have one more child, besides me. Thus I have got an older sister. Her name is Mary. She is in her late twenties. She works in a bank as a chief accountant. She is married and has a wonderful daughter named Alice. I like to play with her. She is very funny and smart. Sometimes I pick her from the nursery school and we walk in the park.
